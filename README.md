# Halfbit AI

## Overview
Halfbit AI is a lightweight Flutter app that enables natural, real-time AI chat fully **offline** on your device. It uses a compact, efficient model to generate AI responses instantly without requiring any internet connection. The app offers a clean and simple chat interface designed for smooth, local AI conversations anytime, anywhere.

## Features
- **Offline AI Chat:** Chat naturally with an AI model running entirely on your device.
- **Instant Responses:** The app loads a small AI model file to generate replies quickly without network delay.
- **Clean User Interface:** Simple and intuitive chat interface for seamless conversations.
- **Privacy-Focused:** Since all AI processing occurs locally, user data never leaves the device.

## Current Status
- The current version is a proof of concept with basic AI chat functionality.
- Some planned features are not yet implemented due to time constraints.

## Planned Improvements
- Integration of better and more powerful AI models for improved understanding and response quality.
- Adding audio and video support to make conversations more interactive and multimodal.
- Developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to enable smarter replies by leveraging local knowledge storage.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Build and run the Flutter app on your preferred device.
3. Start chatting with the AI offline immediately.
